        "For nearly 100 years, scientists have been debating where it is. The expectation was that it would be located in the Republic of Greece, at the foot of Mount Rupel (now Belasitsa), as mentioned by the ancient authors. A Latin inscription of Emperor Galerius from the year 308, captured during a police operation against treasure hunters in 2002, and studied and published by Assoc. Georgi Mitrev., shows categorically that Heraclea lies near Petrich, in the 'Rupite' area.",

        "The city is named after the mythical hero Herakles (Hercules), who is considered the progenitor of the Macedonian dynasty of the Argeads. They founded it in the 4th century BC. in the Thracian-Sinti tribal territory. Heraclea Sintika became a strategic center in the northeastern reaches of the ancient Macedonian kingdom. During the reign of Philip II of Macedon, Heraclea became one of the Macedonian royal residences. This is where the first military campaigns of Alexander the Great began. It was from Heraclea that he marched against neighboring Thracian tribes before conquering the vast Persian Empire.",
      text4:
        "In 148 BC Heraclea Sintica was annexed to the province of Macedonia within the Roman Empire. The city was patronized by Octavian Augustus himself - the founder of the Roman Empire. It was during its Roman period, 2nd - 3rd centuries AD, that Heracleia Sintika experienced its greatest prosperity. The exceptional scale, quality and artistic value of the architecture of the central part of the city testifies to the prosperity of the city.",

The fortification was an 8-kilometer protective wall starting from the foot of Belasitsa Mountain and reaching the foot of Ograzhden. During the construction of the fortification, the old Bulgarian construction traditions were demonstrated to a large extent, with the most characteristic element being the ramparts and ditches. The fortification was protected by three ramparts and two moats, located concentrically, the traces of which can still be seen today.",
